It's Android's first OpenOffice Document Reader!

This is an Android frontend for the excellent ODF Java library called odf2html (formerly JOpenDocument), made by Andi (https://github.com/andiwand/odf2html).
Feel free to use it in your own projects too, but please don't forget to tell us about your projects! :)

Get the app from Google Play store (http://www.appbrain.com/app/openoffice-document-reader/at.tomtasche.reader?install)

More information at http://reader.tomtasche.at/ and in the app.
