It's Android's first OpenOffice Document Reader!

This is an Android frontend for the excellent ODF Java library called odf2html (formerly JOpenDocument), made by Andi (https://github.com/andiwand/odf2html).
Feel free to use it in your own project too, but please don't forget to tell us about it!

This project depends on other projects (all included as git submodules).

Here's how to check out the code:
- git clone this project
- change to the newly created directory and run 'git submodule init' and 'git submodule update'
(-) if you're using eclipse you might need to mess around with imports, classpath and stuff. This should be pretty straight-forward though.

Get the app from Google Play store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.tomtasche.reader)

More information at http://reader.tomtasche.at/ and in the app itself.
