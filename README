It's Android's first OpenOffice Document Reader!

This is an Android frontend for the OpenDocument Java library called JOpenDocument, made by Andi (https://github.com/andiwand/JOpenDocument).
Feel free to use it in your own projects too, but please don't forget to tell us about your projects! :)

Don't forget to fetch JOpenDocument too, in order to set up OpenOffice Document Reader in your IDE.


Download at Android Market (http://www.appbrain.com/app/openoffice-document-reader/at.tomtasche.reader?install) or download the .apk directly which can be found in this repository.

By the way, you can flattr us (JOpenDocument and OpenOffice Document Reader) at http://goo.gl/fhecu
